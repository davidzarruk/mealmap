## B-002 — Analytics events
Implemented local analytics event tracking (non-blocking) with AsyncStorage buffer and debug logs.

### Events wired
- `plan_created`: fired on Setup > Save preferences
- `meal_swapped`: fired on Plan swipe-left replacement when replacement exists
- `list_generated`: fired once when shopping list has generated sections/items

### Files
- `mobile/src/lib/analytics.ts` (new)
- `mobile/src/screens/setup/SetupScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/plan/PlanScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/shopping/ShoppingListScreen.tsx`

## B-003 — Onboarding swipe tooltip
Added first-run swipe onboarding tooltip on Plan screen with dismiss button and auto-dismiss.

### Behavior
- Shows only if not dismissed before (`mealmap/swipe-tip-dismissed` key)
- Manual dismiss with “Got it”
- Auto-dismiss after 9s

### Files
- `mobile/src/screens/plan/PlanScreen.tsx`
